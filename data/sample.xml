Hello, and welcome! Wiktionary is a [[multilingual]] [[free]] [[dictionary]], being written [[collaborative]]ly on this website by people from around the world. [[entry|Entries]] may be [[Help:How to edit a page|edit]]ed by anyone!

Designed as the lexical companion to [[:w:Main Page|Wikipedia]], the encyclopedia project, Wiktionary has grown beyond a standard dictionary and now includes a [[Wiktionary:Wikisaurus|thesaurus]], a rhyme guide, phrase books, language statistics and extensive appendices.  We aim to include not only the definition of a word, but also enough information to really understand it. Thus [[etymology|etymologies]], pronunciations, sample quotations, synonyms, antonyms, translations, etc., are included.

Wiktionary is a [[wiki]], which means that you can edit it, and all the content is dual-licensed under both the [[Wiktionary:Text of Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License|Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License]] as well as the [[Wiktionary:GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation License]]. Before you contribute, you may wish to read through some of our [[Wiktionary:Help|Help]] pages, and bear in mind that we do things quite differently from other wikis. In particular, we have strict [[Wiktionary:Entry layout|layout conventions]] and [[Wiktionary:Criteria for inclusion|inclusion criteria]]. Learn how to [[Help:Starting a new page|start a page]], how to [[Help:How to edit a page|edit entries]], experiment in the [[Wiktionary:Sandbox|sandbox]] and visit our [[Wiktionary:Community Portal|Community Portal]] to see how you can participate in the development of Wiktionary.

We have created '''{{NUMBEROFARTICLES}}''' articles since starting in [[December]], 2002, and we’re still growing.

==Editing Wiktionary==
People like you are very active in building this [[project]]. While you are reading this, it is likely someone is editing one of our entries. Many knowledgeable people are already at work, but everybody is [[welcome]]!

Contributing does not require [{{fullurl:Special:Userlogin|type=signup}} logging in], but we would [[prefer]] that you do, as it [[facilitate]]s the [[administration]] of this site. (Note that logging in also prevents the [[Internet Protocol|IP]] address of your computer from being displayed in the [{{fullurl:Wiktionary:Welcome, newcomers|action=history}} page history].)

You can [[dive in]] right now and add or alter a definition, add example sentences, or help us to properly format or categorize entries. You can even [[Help:Starting a new page|create a page]] for a term we’re missing. Please feel free to [[Wiktionary:Be bold in updating pages|be bold]] in editing pages!

How could allowing everyone to edit produce a high‐quality product instead of total disorder?  Because most people want to help, and keeping it open to everyone creates the potential for making many good and ever-improving entries. Records are kept of all changes, so even unhelpful edits can easily be [[revert]]ed by other users. To use a now‐famous [[w:Linus's Law|catchphrase]], in essence: “Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow.”

To start out, users might want to use the ‘[[Special:Recentchanges|Recent changes]]’ or ‘[[Special:Random|Random page]]’ link (found in the navigation box elsewhere on this page), to get an idea of the kinds of pages you can find here. (It might be surprising how many non-English words are entered here!)

==Norms and etiquette==
{{xsee|Help:Interacting with other users}}
One important thing you should know is that we have borrowed from our sister project [[Wikipedia:|Wikipedia]] some [[Wikipedia:Norm (sociology)|cultural norms]] you should respect:
# We try not to argue pointlessly. This isn’t a debate forum. After [[civilized]] and reasonable discussion, we try to reach broad [[consensus]] in order to present an accurate, neutral summary of all relevant facts for future readers.
# We try to make the entries as unbiased as we can, meaning that definitions or descriptions — even of controversial topics — are not meant to be platforms for preaching of any kind.
# Bear in mind this is a ''dictionary'', which means there are many [[Wiktionary:What Wiktionary is not|things it is not]].
# At any point, if you are uncomfortable changing someone else’s work, and you want to add a thought (or question or comment) about an entry or other page, the place is its [[Wiktionary:Talk page|talk page]] (click on the &quot;discussion&quot; tab at the top or the &quot;Discuss this page&quot; link in the sidebar or elsewhere, depending on your preference skin). Note, though, that we try to keep discussion focused on improving this dictionary.

However, there are also some differences between Wikipedia and Wiktionary. If you already have some experience with editing Wikipedia, then you may find our [[Wiktionary:Wiktionary for Wikipedians|guide to Wikipedia users]] useful as a quick introduction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''GNU Free Documentation License''' (GFDL) is a [[w:copyleft|copyleft]] license for free documentation, designed by the [[w:Free Software Foundation|Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) for the [[w:GNU|GNU]] project.  The official text of version 1.1 of the license text can be found at: http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html

The license is designed for software documentation and other reference and instructional materials. It stipulates that any copy of the material, even if modified, carry the same license. Those copies may be sold but, if produced in quantity, have to be made available in a format which facilitates further editing.

== Secondary Sections ==

The license explicitly separates the &quot;[[w:GNU_Free_Documentation_License/Document|Document]]&quot; from &quot;[[w:GNU_Free_Documentation_License/Secondary Sections|Secondary Sections]]&quot;, which may not be integrated with the Document, but exist as front-matter materials or appendices. Secondary sections can contain information regarding the author's or publisher's relationship to the subject matter, but not any subject matter itself. While the Document itself is wholly editable, and is essentially covered by a license equivalent to the [[w:GNU General Public License|GNU General Public License]], some of the secondary sections have various restrictions designed primarily to deal with proper attribution to previous authors.

Specifically, the authors of prior versions have to be acknowledged and certain &quot;invariant sections&quot; specified by the original author and dealing with his or her relationship to the subject matter may not be changed.  If the material is modified, its title has to be changed (unless the prior authors give permission to retain the title). The license also has provisions for the handling of [[w:GNU_Free_Documentation_License/Cover_Texts|front-cover and back-cover texts]] of books, as well as for &quot;History&quot;, &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, &quot;Dedications&quot; and &quot;Endorsements&quot; sections.

== Using the GFDL ==

For a document to be covered by the GFDL, one must include a specific copyright and license notice.

== Wiktionary and GFDL ==

All Wiktionary articles are licensed to the public under the GNU Free Documentation License. See [[Wiktionary:Copyrights]] for the details. The local copy of the license, as required by the terms of the GFDL, is at [[Wiktionary:Text of the GNU Free Documentation License]].

Version 1.1, March 2000

&lt;pre&gt;
Copyright (C) 2000  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
&lt;/pre&gt;

== 0. PREAMBLE ==

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other written document &quot;free&quot; in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of &quot;copyleft&quot;, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

==  1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS ==

This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. The &quot;Document&quot;, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.

A &quot;Modified Version&quot; of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.

A &quot;Secondary Section&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

The &quot;Invariant Sections&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License.

The &quot;Cover Texts&quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License.

A &quot;Transparent&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not &quot;Transparent&quot; is called &quot;Opaque&quot;.

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML designed for human modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

The &quot;Title Page&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, &quot;Title Page&quot; means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

== 2. VERBATIM COPYING ==

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.

== 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY ==

If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

== 4. MODIFICATIONS ==

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

* A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
* B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).
* C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.
* D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
* E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.
* F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
* G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.
* H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
* I. Preserve the section entitled &quot;History&quot;, and its title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section entitled &quot;History&quot; in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.
* J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the &quot;History&quot; section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
* K. In any section entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; or &quot;Dedications&quot;, preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.
* L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.
* M. Delete any section entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;. Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version.
* N. Do not retitle any existing section as &quot;Endorsements&quot; or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

== 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS ==

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled &quot;History&quot; in the various original documents, forming one section entitled &quot;History&quot;; likewise combine any sections entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, and any sections entitled &quot;Dedications&quot;. You must delete all sections entitled &quot;Endorsements.&quot;

== 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS ==

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

== 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS ==

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation. Such a compilation is called an &quot;aggregate&quot;, and this License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.

== 8. TRANSLATION ==

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License provided that you also include the original English version of this License. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original English version of this License, the original English version will prevail.

== 9. TERMINATION ==

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

Wiktionary is an online [[dictionary]] and, as a means to that end, also an [[w:online community|online community]]. Therefore, there are certain things that Wiktionary is ''not''.

== What Wiktionary is not ==

# Wiktionary is '''not an [[encyclopedia]], a genealogy database, or an atlas'''; that is, it is not an in-depth collection of factual information, or of data about places and people. Encyclopedic information should be placed in our sister project, [[w:Main page|Wikipedia]]. Wiktionary entries are about words. A Wiktionary entry should focus on matters of language and wordsmithing: spelling, pronunciation, etymology, translation, concept, usage, quotations{{,}} and links to related words.
# Wiktionary is '''not an [[arbiter]] of what is good English'''; correct English, acceptable English, suitable English, or even grammatical. Wiktionary [[describes]] usage, it does not [[prescribe]] nor [[proscribe]] it, and adheres only to its [[WT:CFI|criteria for inclusion]], which state that any term or meaning that can be shown to be in sufficiently widespread use may be included. By including or not including a certain term, it by no means accepts or attempts to promote a certain point of view, but is simply documenting, explaining what '''is in use''' in English or any other language.
#&lt;span id=&quot;CRYSTAL&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Wiktionary is '''not a [[crystal ball]]'''. Wiktionary does not try to predict which new words will actually achieve use. It usually depends on verifiable proof of usage over a year.
#&lt;span id=&quot;NOTPAPER&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Wiktionary is '''[[m:Wiki is not paper|not paper]]'''. Thus, Wiktionary effectively has no size limits, can include links, can be more timely, etc. It also means that the style and length of writing appropriate for paper may not be appropriate here. There is less need to use abbreviations. There is less need to exclude arguable entries. If enough people support a well-formed entry, then there should be no need to call for its deletion.
# Wiktionary is '''not a soapbox, chatroom{{,}} or discussion forum'''. However, there are [[Wiktionary:Discussion rooms|discussion rooms]] to discuss Wiktionary-related topics.
# Wiktionary is '''neither a [[w:Mirror (computing)|mirror]] nor a repository of links, images{{,}} or media files'''. Any content added to Wiktionary may be subject to merciless editing or deletion.
# Wiktionary is '''not a free wiki host or webspace provider'''. You may not host your own website at Wiktionary. If you are interested in using the [[wiki]] technology for a collaborative effort on anything other than writing a dictionary of all words in all languages, even if it is just a single page, there are many sites that provide wiki hosting. You can even install [[mw:|Wiktionary's wiki software]] on your server.
# Wiktionary is '''not a battlefield'''. Every user is expected to interact with others [[Wiktionary:Civility|civilly]], calmly and in a spirit of cooperation. Do not [[Wiktionary:No personal attacks|insult]], harass or intimidate those with whom you have a disagreement. Rather, approach the matter in an intelligent manner, and engage in polite discussion. Do not create or edit entries just to prove a point. Do not make legal or other threats against Wiktionary, Wiktionarians{{,}} or the Wikimedia Foundation. Threats are not tolerated and may result in a [[WT:BLOCK|ban]].
# Wiktionary is '''not [[w:Censorship|censored]]''' (nor is it [[w:MPAA film rating system|content-rated]]). Anyone can edit an entry and the results are displayed instantaneously; thus, we cannot guarantee that someone will not see or read something objectionable.  In addition, Wiktionary has no organized system for the removal of material that might be thought likely to harm minors. However, entries can be censored by consensus.
# Wiktionary is '''not just for English'''. Wiktionary is a dictionary  written in one language and covering all words in all languages, just as Wikipedia is an encyclopedia written in one language of all topics from all language-areas. Each Wiktionary seeks to define all words from all languages in its own language, so that readers will be able to find definitions of all words in all languages in their own language. This Wiktionary is written in English, so it is in a way an English dictionary, an English-to-anything and an anything-to-English dictionary all in one. Although one could look up {{m|fr|être}} at fr.wiktionary ([[:fr:être]]), its definition will be in French. So if that person doesn’t speak any French, they still wouldn’t know what ''être'' meant, and it wouldn’t be of any help to them.

== Wiktionary is not Wikipedia ==
{{shortcut|WT:WINW}}
{{main|Wiktionary:Wiktionary for Wikipedians}}

Although Wiktionary and Wikipedia are sister projects, '''Wiktionary is not Wikipedia'''. Some of our policies are similar to some of Wikipedia's policies; others are quite different. The way we do things here is similar in some respects to the way things are done at Wikipedia; in other respects, it's very different.

; Differences in content
:* Unlike Wikipedia, Wiktionary does not have a &quot;notability&quot; criterion; rather, we have an &quot;attestation&quot; criterion, and (for multi-word terms) an &quot;idiomaticity&quot; requirement. There are some similarities here — [[w:Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not for things made up one day|neither Wiktionary nor Wikipedia is for &quot;things made up one day&quot;]] — but also some differences. Our &quot;attestation&quot; requirement is much less subjective than Wikipedia's &quot;notability&quot; requirement; and we include all terms in all languages, including very obscure or rare terms, provided they meet [[Wiktionary:Criteria for inclusion|our criteria for inclusion (CFI)]].
:* Wiktionary is a ''secondary source'' for its subject matter (words and phrases) whereas Wikipedia is a ''tertiary source'' for its subject matter (topics). This means that while Wikipedia documents what other people say about topics, Wiktionary documents words and phrases itself without relying on the statements of other people. As a consequence, the requirements of verifiability are very different. Verification on Wikipedia asks &quot;can we find a credible source that says it is the case?&quot; while on Wiktionary we ask &quot;can we find real-life examples to show it is the case?&quot;. This also means that whereas Wikipedia discourages original research and relies on the research of others, Wiktionary users themselves actively research terms and their meanings.

; Differences in community
:* Wiktionary has a different [[WT:BLOCK|blocking policy]] than Wikipedia, and administrators don't usually issue warnings unless edits can be assumed to have been made in good faith.
:* Because there are so many pages on Wiktionary with relatively little content, talk pages of individual pages are not often used. Instead, discussion is usually centralised in [[WT:BP|Beer Parlour]], [[WT:TR|Tea room]] and other discussion rooms.
:* Unlike Wikipedia, which encourages users to be creative with user boxes on their personal pages, Wiktionary allows only userboxes that are relevant to your work on Wiktionary itself. This includes most importantly [[WT:Babel|language userboxes]], which display the languages that you know.

; Differences in organization
:* Unlike Wikipedia, Wiktionary's page names are case sensitive. [[Hand]] and [[hand]] are different pages. When several pages exist that differ only in their capitalisation, the template {{temp|also}} is placed at the very beginning of the page to redirect between them.
:* There are no disambiguation pages on Wiktionary, and we do not create redirects for alternative forms, spellings or inflected forms of words. Instead, a small stub entry is created with a template that links back to the main form. Many such stub entries are created automatically using various [[WT:BOT|bots]].

; Differences in page format and wikitext
:* Wiktionary has a very rigid page format, detailed at [[WT:ELE|Entry Layout Explained]].
:* Wiktionary makes heavy use of templates for all kinds of things, and each language often has its own set of templates. Learning to use the templates of the language you are working on is very important; templates can be found at [[:Category:Templates by language]]. Categories, formatting and linking also often use templates for consistent formatting.
:* Wiktionary uses [[WT:LANGCODE|language codes]] extensively for any language-specific purposes involving templates. For example, many templates use &lt;tt&gt;en&lt;/tt&gt; to refer to the English language, or &lt;tt&gt;cmn&lt;/tt&gt; to refer to Mandarin Chinese. Knowing the code of the language you are working on is very important, and necessary for almost any kind of editing on Wiktionary.
:* On Wiktionary, categories are often added to pages by the templates used on that page, so there is no need to put them directly on the page. In particular, [[Wiktionary:Headword-line templates|headword-line templates]] and context templates are most commonly used to add entries to the appropriate categories.

===Etymology===
From {{inh|en|enm|free}}, {{m|enm|fre}}, {{m|enm|freo}}, from {{inh|en|ang|frēo||free}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*frijaz||beloved, not in bondage}}, from {{inh|en|ine-pro|*priHós||dear, beloved}}, from {{m|ine-pro|*preyH-||to love, to please}}. Related to {{m|en|friend}}. Cognate with {{cog|fy|frij||free}}, {{cog|nl|vrij||free}}, {{cog|nds|free||free}}, {{cog|de|frei||free}}, {{m|de|Friede||peace}}, {{cog|da|-}}, {{cog|sv|-}} and {{cog|no|fri||free}}, {{cog|sa|प्रिय|tr=priyá}}.

Germanic and Celtic are the only Indo-European language branches in which the PIE word with the meaning of &quot;dear, beloved&quot; acquired the additional meaning of &quot;free&quot; in the sense of &quot;not in bondage&quot;. This was an extension of the idea of &quot;characteristic of those who are dear and beloved&quot;, in other words friends and tribe members (in contrast to unfree inhabitants from other tribes and prisoners of war, many of which were among the slaves – compare the Latin use of [[liberi]] to mean both &quot;free persons&quot; and &quot;children of a family&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{R:Etymonline}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dwds.de/wb/frei &quot;frei&quot;] in Digitales Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache&lt;/ref&gt;

The verb comes from {{der|en|enm|freen}}, {{m|enm|freoȝen}}, from {{der|en|ang|frēon}}, {{m|ang|frēoġan||to free; make free}}.

While this Wiktionary is known as the English Wiktionary, it is still a matter of fundamental policy that this dictionary includes &quot;all words in all languages&quot;.  To the broad extent that this is applicable it necessitates that some articles will need to reflect the structure and peculiarities of the language in question at the moment. The pages listed in the category [[:Category:Wiktionary language considerations]] deal with how to manage entries in a specific language, or instances of words in that language on other pages.

There are some general issues that affect a wide range of languages. These include
*[[Wiktionary:Transliteration|Transliteration]]
*[[Wiktionary:Languages with more than one grammatical gender|Existence of more than one grammatical gender]]

[[Image:PWN Encyclopedia.jpg|thumb|right|The National Scientific Publishers encyclopedia (Polish)]]

===Alternative forms===
* {{qualifier|Britain}} [[encyclopaedia]]
* {{qualifier|obsolete}} [[encyclopædia]]

===Etymology===
From {{bor|en|NL.|encyclopaedia|t=general education}}, from Renaissance {{der|en|grc|ἐγκυκλοπαιδεία|t=education in the circle of arts and sciences}}, a mistaken [[univerbation|univerbated]] form of {{der|en|grc-koi|ἐγκύκλιος παιδείᾱ|t=education in the circle of arts and sciences}}, from {{m|grc|ἐγκύκλιος|t=circular}} + {{m|grc|παιδείᾱ|t=child-rearing, education}}.

===Pronunciation===
* {{a|Canada}} {{IPA|/ənˌsəɪ.kləˈpi.di.ə/|lang=en}}
* {{a|UK|US}} {{IPA|/ɪnˌsaɪ.kləˈpi(ː).di.ə/|lang=en}}
* {{audio|en-us-encyclopedia.ogg|Audio (US)|lang=en}}
* {{rhymes|iːdiə|lang=en}}
* {{hyphenation|en|cy|clo|pe|dia|lang=en}}

===Noun===
{{en-noun|s|encyclopediae|encyclopediæ}}

# A [[comprehensive]] [[reference work]] (often spanning several printed volumes) with articles (usually arranged in alphabetical order, or sometimes arranged by category) on a range of [[subjects]], sometimes general, sometimes limited to a particular field.
#: ''I only use the library for the '''encyclopedia''', as we’ve got most other books here.''
#: ''His life's work was a four-volume '''encyclopedia''' of aviation topics.''
# {{lb|en|dated}} The [[circle]] of [[arts]] and [[sciences]]; a [[comprehensive]] summary of [[knowledge]], or of a branch of knowledge.

====Usage notes====
The spelling ''encyclopedia'' is standard in American English, preferred in Canadian English, accepted in Australian and International English, and also very common in British English. It is more common than ''encyclopaedia'', for example, in UK newspapers on Google News in 2009 by a 7:3 margin.

===Etymology 1===
From {{inh|en|enm|cat}}, {{m|enm|catte}}, from {{inh|en|ang|catt||male cat}}, {{m|ang|catte||female cat}}, from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*kattuz}}.
{{rel-top|Further etymology and cognates.}}
The Germanic word is generally thought to be from {{der|en|LL.|cattus||domestic cat}} (c. 350, [[w:Rutilius Taurus Aemilianus Palladius|Palladius]]), from {{der|en|la|catta}} (c. 75 {{small|A.D.}}, [[w:Martial|Martial]]),&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Harper, ''Online Etymology Dictionary'', s.v. &quot;cat&quot;, [html], retrieved on 29 September 2009: [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=cat].&lt;/ref&gt; from an {{der|en|afa}} language. This would roughly match how domestic cats themselves spread, as genetic studies suggest they began to spread out of the [[Near East]] / [[Fertile Crescent]] during the Neolithic (being in Cyprus by 9500 years ago,&lt;ref name=&quot;ISample&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;COttoni&quot;/&gt; and Greece and Italy by 2500 years ago&lt;ref&gt;Charles Ginenthal, ''Pillars of the Past'', volume three&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dennis C. Turner, ‎Patrick Bateson, ''The Domestic Cat: The Biology of its Behaviour'' ({{ISBN|1107512212}}), page 93&lt;/ref&gt;), especially after they became popular in Egypt.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISample&quot;&gt;Ian Sample, ''[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/jun/29/genetics.sciencenews DNA research identifies homeland of the domestic cat]'', in ''The Guardian'' (29 June 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;COttoni&quot;&gt;Claudio Ottoni, Wim Van Neer, Eva-Maria Geigl, et al, ''The palaeogenetics of cat dispersal in the ancient world'', in ''Nature: Ecology &amp; Evolution'', volume 1 (19 June 2017) (doi: 10.1038/s41559-017-0139); summarized e.g. by [http://blogs.plos.org/onscienceblogs/2017/06/23/where-did-cats-come-from/ PLOS]&lt;/ref&gt; However, every proposed source word has presented problems. [[w:Adolphe Pictet|Adolphe Pictet]]&lt;ref&gt;Adolphe Pictet, ''Les origines indo-européennes ou les Aryas primitifs: essai de paléontologie linguistique'', vol. 1 (Paris: Joël Cherbuliez, 1859), 381.&lt;/ref&gt; and many subsequent sources refer to [[w:Barabra|Barabra]] (Nubian) {{m|onw|tr=kaddîska}} and &quot;Nouba&quot; (Nobiin) {{m|fia|kadīs}} as possible sources or cognates,&lt;ref&gt;Otto Keller, ''Die antike Tierwelt'', vol. 1: ''Säugetiere'' (Leipzig, 1909), 75; Walther von Wartburg, ed. ''[[w:Französisches Etymologisches Wörterbuch|Französisches etymologisches Wörterbuch]]'', vol. 2 (Basel: R. G. Zbinden, 1922–1967), 520.&lt;/ref&gt; but M. Lionel Bender says the Nubian word is a loan from {{noncog|ar|قِطَّة}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Qitta&quot;&gt;John Huehnergard, “Qitta: Arabic Cats”, in ''Classical Arabic Humanities in Their Own Terms'', ed. Beatrice Gruendler (Leiden: Brill, 2008), 407–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Jean-Paul Savignac suggests the Latin word is from an Egyptian precursor of {{cog|cop|ϣⲁⲩ||tomcat}} suffixed with feminine {{m|egy|-t}},&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Savignac, ''Dictionnaire français-gaulois'', s.v. &quot;[[chat]]&quot; (Paris: Errance, 2004), 82.&lt;/ref&gt; but John Huehnergard says &quot;the source [...] was clearly not Egyptian itself, where no analogous form is attested.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Qitta&quot;/&gt;

Huehnergard opines it is &quot;equally likely that the forms might derive from an ancient Germanic word, imported into Latin and thence to Greek and to Syriac and Arabic&quot;. Guus Kroonen also considers the word to be native to Germanic (due to morphological alternations) and Northern Europe, and suggests that it might ultimately be borrowed from Uralic, compare {{noncog|se|gađfe||female stoat}} and {{noncog|hu|hölgy||stoat; lady, bride}} from {{noncog|urj-pro|*käďwä||female (of a fur animal)}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{R:gem:Kroonen 2013|*kattōn-}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using public domain works as a base for Wiktionary: Several public domain works can be used for sourcing texts into Wiktionary. Webster's dictionary from 1913 is available in plain text online, convenient for copying and pasting. The Century Dictionary 1911 is available as DJVU online, and has to be manually retyped. Some volumes of Oxford English Dictionary are available as DJVU and have to be manually retyped. There are some other sources in public domain, such as 1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue available in plain text.

==Webster 1913==

See also [[Wiktionary:Webster's Dictionary, 1913]]. Many definitions from ''Webster’s New International Dictionary of the English Language'', 1913, have been imported into Wiktionary. There is the template {{temp|webster 1913}} and the category [[:Category:Webster 1913]]. The dictionary has etymologies, definitions, and synonyms.

Available online for search at [http://humanities.uchicago.edu/forms_unrest/webster.form.html ARTFL Project]; available as one huge plain text file from [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/29765 Project Gutenberg #29675].

For a past discussion from 2002 and 2003, see the talk page.

==Century 1911==

''The Century Dictionary'', 1911 is a public domain dictionary available as DJVU from [http://www.global-language.com/CENTURY/ www.global-language.com]. It can be read with a DJVU plugin, but also without it in a JPEG version. It is in public domain per its being  published in the United States pre-1924.

==Oxford English Dictionary==

He is scanning those fascicles published in the US before 1924, maybe because in the UK the copyright is [http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=16644 extended to author's life + 70 years]. There seem to be no plain text files converted using OCR.

The volume 1 of OED, 1884, is also available at Fractionary, starting at OED:1_1, and ending at OED:1_1240.

A number of scans are available through a [http://www.openwordbook.org web interface] as of 2012.

=====Usage notes=====
In English and other languages with a tradition of space-delimited writing, it is customary to treat &quot;word&quot; as referring to any sequence of characters delimited by spaces. However, this is not applicable to languages such as {{l|en|[[Chinese]] and [[Japanese]], which are normally written without spaces, or to languages such as [[Vietnamese]], which are written with spaces delimiting [[syllable]]s}}.

In computing, the size (length) of a word, while being fixed in a particular machine or processor family design, can be different in different designs, for many reasons. See {{w|Word (computing)}} for a full [[explanation]].

# Abbreviation for [[pound-force]], a unit of force/weight. Using this abbreviation to describe pound-force is inaccurate and unscientific.

=====Usage notes=====
* Internationally, the &quot;pound&quot; has most commonly referred to the UK pound, £, (pound sterling). The other currencies were usually distinguished in some way, e.g., the &quot;Irish pound&quot; or the &quot;punt&quot;.
* In the vicinity of each other country calling its currency the pound among English speakers the local currency would be the &quot;pound&quot;, with all others distinguished, e.g., the &quot;British pound&quot;, the &quot;Egyptian pound&quot; etc.
* The general plural of &quot;pound&quot; has usually been &quot;pounds&quot; (at least since Chaucer), but the continuing use of the Old English genitive or neuter &quot;pound&quot; as the plural after numerals (for both currency and weight) is common in some regions. It can be considered correct, or colloquial, depending on region.

Its apparent simplicity explains why it is scrutinised down to tenths of a percentage point every month.}}

===Etymology===
Proposed in 1908 as part of the new Latvian spelling by the scientific commission headed by [[w:Kārlis Mīlenbahs|K. Mīlenbahs]], which was accepted and began to be taught in schools in 1909. Prior to that, Latvian had been written in German [[Fraktur]], and sporadically in [[Cyrillic]].

====Letter====

===Etymology 2===
From {{inh|lb|goh|ouga}}, from {{inh|lb|gem-pro|*augô}}, ultimately from {{der|lb|ine-pro|*h₃ekʷ-||eye; to see}}. The phonetic development in Luxembourgish is regular: Old High German ''-ou-'' becomes ''-ā-''; intervocalic ''-g-'' is lost; word-final short vowels are apocopated.

====Noun====
{{lb-noun|n|Aen}}

# [[eye]]

===Etymology 3===
From {{inh|lb|gmh|ouwe}}, from {{inh|lb|goh|ouwa}}, from {{inh|lb|gem-pro|*awjō}}. Cognate with {{cog|de|Aue}}, {{cog|en|eyot}}, {{cog|is|ey}}, {{cog|da|ø}}, {{cog|sv|ö}}.

===Etymology 2===
{{inh|en|enm|crowen}}, from {{inh|en|ang|crāwan}} (past tense {{m|ang|crēow}}, past participle {{m|ang|crāwen}}), from {{inh|en|gem-pro|*krēaną}} (compare Dutch {{m|nl|kraaien}}, German {{m|de|krähen}}), from {{inh|en|ine-pro|*greh₂-}} ‘to caw, croak’ (compare Lithuanian {{m|lt|gróti}}, Russian {{m|ru|гра́ять}}). Related to {{m|en|croak}}.

==English==
The following tables show the [[Wiktionary:International Phonetic Alphabet|International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) and the English pronunciation (enPR) or {{w|American Heritage Dictionary}} (AHD) symbols which are used to represent the various sounds of the {{w|English language}}. The sounds of [[Received Pronunciation]] (RP, UK), [[General American]] pronunciation (GenAm, US), Canadian English (CanE), Australian English (AuE){{,}} and New Zealand English (NZE) are shown.

For vowels in other dialects, see Wikipedia's {{w|IPA chart for English}}.

:''An [[:Image:IPA Chart for English 2.png|image of an old version of these tables]] is available.''

===[[vowel|Vowels]]===
For a fuller list of dialects, see {{w|International Phonetic Alphabet chart for English dialects}}.

This table is divided into two groups: non-rhotic dialects (RP, Australia, New Zealand) and rhotic dialects (General American and Canadian). Non-rhotic dialects do not pronounce what was historically a syllable-final ''r''; instead they have a schwa ({{IPAchar|/ə/}} or, in NZ, {{IPAchar|/ɘ/}}), centering diphthong (ending in {{IPAchar|/ə̯/}}){{,}} or a long vowel (ending in {{IPAfont|ː}}). In addition to pronouncing syllable-final ''r'', the rhotic dialects do not have a vowel length distinction, so none of their vowels end in the length symbol {{IPAfont|ː}}.

This vowel table lists both [[monophthong]]s and [[diphthong]]s.

In order to allow [[Module:syllables]] to count syllables, the disyllabic sequence {{IPAchar|/iə/}} must be transcribed with a period to mark the syllable break &amp;ndash; {{IPAchar|/i.ə/}} &amp;ndash; so that it will not be confused with the New Zealand diphthong {{IPAchar|/iə/}}.

{{IPAchar|/ɹ/}} in the vowel plus {{IPAchar|/ɹ/}} sequences is sometimes replaced with {{IPAchar|/ɚ/}}: {{IPAchar|/ðɛɚ/}} instead of {{IPAchar|/ðɛɹ/}}. In order to keep [[Module:syllables]] from counting {{IPAchar|/ɚ/}} as a syllable, add the non-syllabic diacritic: {{IPAchar|/ðɛɚ̯/}}.

====Fortis and lenis====
The so-called voiceless and voiced obstruents are more properly {{w|fortis and lenis}}. Each member of a fortis&amp;ndash;lenis pair is distinguished from the other by various articulatory and auditory features, but not consistently by voicing or lack of it.

In most dialects of English, the fortis (voiceless) stops and affricate {{IPAchar|/p t tʃ k/}} are always voiceless, and are aspirated ({{IPAchar|[pʰ tʰ tʃʰ kʰ]}}) at the beginning of a word and at the beginning of a stressed syllable: for example, RP ''today'' {{IPAchar|[tʰəˈdeɪ]}}, ''chain'' {{IPAchar|[tʃʰeɪn]}} and ''account'' {{IPAchar|[əˈkʰaʊnt]}}. Vowels and [[w:sonorant|sonorant]]s immediately preceding syllable final fortis obstruents are usually pronounced shorter than before lenis obstruents, as in [[bet|''b'''e'''t'']] vs. [[bed|''b'''e'''d'']] and [[bent|''be'''n'''t'']] vs. [[bend|''be'''n'''d'']]. This phenomenon is known as pre-fortis [[w:Clipping (phonetics)|clipping]].

The lenis (voiced) stops and affricate {{IPAchar|/b d dʒ ɡ/}} are always unaspirated. Lenis obstruents {{IPAchar|/b v ð d z dʒ ʒ ɡ/}} are often devoiced at the beginning or end of words, but are fully voiced between voiced vowels and sonorants.

The fortis&amp;ndash;lenis distinction is neutralized in a few cases.

Initial consonant clusters consisting of {{IPAchar|/s/}} and a stop (as in {{m|en|spill}}, {{m|en|still}}, {{m|en|skill}}) are typically analyzed as having a fortis stop, which agrees with the spelling, but may equally well be analyzed as having a lenis stop (i.e., {{m|en||*sbill}}, {{m|en||*sdill}}, {{m|en||*sgill}}). The stop is both voiceless and unaspirated, and there is no additional phonetic feature that establishes it as either fortis or lenis.

In addition, American English has a sound change known as intervocalic alveolar {{w|flapping}}, in which {{IPAchar|/t d/}} are both pronounced as an alveolar flap {{IPAchar|[ɾ]}} between vowels or liquids and when not at the beginning of a stressed syllable, and {{IPAchar|/nt/}} between vowels may be pronounced as a nasalized alveolar flap, {{IPAchar|[ɾ̃]}}. The fortis stop {{IPAchar|/t/}} loses its distinctive voicelessness, and essentially becomes lenis. Flapping causes {{m|en|latter}} and {{m|en|ladder}} to both be pronounced as {{IPAchar|[ˈɫæɾɚ]}}, and causes {{m|en|winter}} to be pronounced as {{IPAchar|[ˈwɪ̃ɾ̃ɚ]}}, similar to {{m|en|winner}} {{IPAchar|[ˈwɪ̃nɚ]}}.
